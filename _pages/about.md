#### Welcome! 

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at the [University of Notre Dame](https://acms.nd.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yuefeng Han](https://yuefenghan.github.io/).

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Master’s degree from the [University of Chicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) and a Bachelor’s degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/programs/ugedu.html), both in Statistics. I completed my [Master’s thesis](https://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/stat/docs/Stu-Seminars/2022-23/Xu_Ke_050323.pdf?mtime=1682114561) under the guidance of Professors [Lin S. Chen](https://home.uchicago.edu/lchen11/) and [Guillaume Bal](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~guillaumebal/), and my Bachelor’s thesis under Professor Xinsheng Zhang. While it is too brief to list everyone who has influenced my academic journey, I am deeply grateful to all the mentors and peers who have inspired and supported me along the way.

Originally from Jixi, a quaint town in Huizhou region near [Mount Huangshan](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/547/), I later moved to Shanghai, where I spent most of my formative years, all thanks to the unwavering support of my family.

#### Research Interest:

My research spans a broad range of topics in mathematical statistics, with a focus on developing theoretical frameworks for **statistical inference on complex data**, including multilinear **tensors**, infinite-dimensional **functions**, and large-scale **genomics**. 

Methodologically, I am interested in the design and analysis of **iterative**, **randomized**, and **regularization**-based algorithms. 

I am also passionate about statistical applications in the biomedical and physical sciences. I am always open to collabortion :)
